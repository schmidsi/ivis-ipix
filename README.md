## Journal
- I wanted to use the opportunity to try out [next.js][next.js] as framework and 
  [yarn][https://yarnpkg.com/en/] as package manager
- Since I'm using [airbnb linter][airbnb-lint], it shows a validation error
  saying, that I need to use `.jsx` as extension when I use jsx-syntax
- Short research unveals that this is by design in next.js and it is not easy to
  fix nor [they will address this issue soon][next.js#200].
- Therefore, I drop next.js and move on to [facebookincubator/create-react-app][create-react-app]
